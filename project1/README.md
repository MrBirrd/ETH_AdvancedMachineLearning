# Project 1
## About
This task was a regression problem with a lot of features, having no description, which made the task very black-box like. Additionally, there is a lot of noise added and the data was augmented by a factor of 4, so there are many columns with "fake data".

## Processing, Model and Results
In the end, combining several models with correlation-based feature selection gave top results on the courses private test set with a R2 score of 0.764.

Since was more like a Kaggle competition with no description of the dataset, I didn't learn anything new on this task and it was not the most exciting one.
